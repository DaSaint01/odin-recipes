    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Make dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl; dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

    <h3>Step 3</h3>

    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat; brush the grate with garlic oil.</p>

    <h3>Step 10</h3>
    <p>Carefully place one piece of dough on the hot grill. Dough will begin to puff almost immediately. When the bottom crust has lightly browned, turn dough over using two spatulas.</p>
